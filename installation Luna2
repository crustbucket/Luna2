As root open /usr/share/icons and paste Luna2 folder there.

CAUTION: make sure to check the permissions of all folders.  In the system and root folders make sure that root/root permissions exists and user permissions to access folders exist on all folders both at the top level and all internal folders.  Make sure user permissions exist on all folders/files in the home directory.
